	<description>I've always thought gold didn't have enough uses in-game. As the only real use was statues, trading and eventually floor. This is now an old story! I present you Jewelry! The mod adds new apparels: necklace, ring, bracelet and earrings. They are all made of gold, and a stuffable. It can be stone (Marble, granite...) or gemstones. Vanilla Rimworld only adds one gemstone, jade. This is why this mod also add diamond, sapphire and ruby. With all those new recipes, I thought it was also a good idea to add a new production bench. The laser sculpting table, 50% faster than the vanilla sculpting table!</description>
